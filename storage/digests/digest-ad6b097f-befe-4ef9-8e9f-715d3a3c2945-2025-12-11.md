# BusinessWorld Online - Policy & Data Digest

## Executive Summary
This week's updates from BusinessWorld Online highlight significant developments in the Philippine energy sector, particularly focusing on traditional energy investments amidst a global shift toward renewables. Meralco PowerGen Corp. (MGEN) is actively pursuing offtake agreements for a new 1,200-MW coal-fired power plant in Quezon province, despite a government moratorium on new coal projects. This initiative underscores the continued reliance on coal to meet rising energy demands, with plans to supply electricity to approximately five million households by February 2030.

In regulatory news, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has proposed new tiered public ownership rules for Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). This regulatory change aims to facilitate a more flexible ownership structure, potentially encouraging more companies, particularly in the energy and infrastructure sectors, to go public. These developments reflect ongoing dynamics in the energy market and regulatory landscape, which are crucial for stakeholders to monitor.

## New Circulars & Policy Documents
- **SEC Proposed Tiered Public Ownership Rules**: The SEC has introduced a proposal for tiered public ownership rules aimed at enhancing the attractiveness of IPOs in the Philippines. This initiative is designed to provide companies with greater flexibility in ownership structures, which could stimulate investment in the energy sector.

## Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)
- **Meralco PowerGen Corp. Offtake Agreements**: MGEN is in the process of securing offtake agreements for its planned 1,200-MW coal-fired power plant. The company is preparing to engage in a competitive selection process or a baseload capacity auction, in coordination with the Department of Energy.

## Price & Market Updates
- **WESM Prices**: No specific updates on Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) prices were reported during this period. Stakeholders are encouraged to monitor market trends closely as new capacity comes online.

## Energy Mix Updates
- **Coal Generation**: The proposed 1,200-MW coal plant by MGEN indicates a continued commitment to coal as a significant part of the energy mix in the Philippines. This development comes at a time when the global energy landscape is increasingly favoring renewable sources, highlighting a potential divergence in local energy policy.

## Other Notable Changes
- **Government Moratorium on New Coal Projects**: Despite the existing moratorium on new coal projects, MGEN has received certification to proceed with its coal plant in Quezon. This exception may set a precedent for future projects and reflects ongoing debates about energy security versus environmental concerns.
